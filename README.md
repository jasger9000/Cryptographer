# Cryptographer

## A Cryptography tool used to encrypt and decrypt files written in python

This project is a tool used to encrypt and decrypt files and messages using symmetric (meaning one key encryption/decryption) and asymmetric (meaning two key encryption/decryption) to protect your privacy.
The project is fully written in python and very user friendly. You can easily encrypt and decrypt whole files of any type such as video, picture and audio files.

 * Encrypt and decrypt **files** and **messages**
 * Switch between Asymmetric Encryption(Encryption with a Public and Private Key)
 * As well as Symmetric Encryption(Encryption with a single Key)
 * Convenient and easy to understand Interface
